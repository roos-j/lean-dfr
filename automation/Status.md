## Proof ledger

No mathematical statements or proofs have been translated during setup.
After reading each available source, expand that task into substantial steps in
forward dependency order before implementing it. Task 4 follows all of Tasks 1-3.
Place any justified reusable-prerequisite sections before the consuming proof rows.

## Verification

Setup build: lake build passed (3345 jobs), 2026-09-10T09:46:43.7252496-04:00. Both DFR and the new
Auto.SmoothingIneq2D.Smoothing2D module were covered. Existing dependency linter warnings remain.
Axiom audits: not applicable yet; there are no completed Auto targets.
Reduction gate: closed.

## Continuation

Task 1 starter: Auto/SmoothingIneq2D/Smoothing2D.lean.
Next: assign Task 1, read Theorem 5 and its proof, and record the source dependency
plan. Tasks 2-4 have no blueprints yet. Exported theorem interfaces: none.

Skill copies: SHA-256 verified against installed editions (Codex: 6 files; Claude: 5).
Git diff --check passed; automation/raw.md is ignored.
The initial broad Mathlib import build was stopped during starter compilation;
the final starter uses Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Module.Basic and the full build passed.

## Current verification policy

2026-09-10T09:58:01.5996155-04:00 - Auto is excluded from lakefile.toml by explicit user instruction. The setup build above is historical evidence only. Current lake build passed (3343 jobs) for configured targets; it does not check Auto. Owned Auto sources require separate direct lake env lean checks. Both vendored skill editions and their bootstrap references now follow this policy.
Task 1 source study is underway; no mathematical declarations have been added or proved. Theorem 5 and portions of Section 3 have been read; the full proof/dependency audit remains unfinished.

2026-09-10T09:58:47.5716059-04:00 - Task 1 paused by explicit user request after the Auto build-inclusion instruction cleanup. No Lean source edits or proofs were made. Source study remains incomplete; resume with the full Section 3 dependency audit only when directed. Documentation diff check passed.
